# MyReads Project

Hello, and welcome to the MyReads Project. This app is React-based, created using `create-react-app`.

MyReads is a simple reading list tracker. Add books you're currently reading, want to read or have currently read to the relevant bookshelf by searching via the input on the searchpage (/`search`), using the dropdown. You can use the dropdown component either on the search or homepage to move books between shelves.

# Installation and running the app

1. Install the necessary npm packages with `npm install` on the command line.
2. Run the development server with `npm start`.
